[b]Welcome to Learning CPTED![/b]

[i]The objective of this game is to make the environment as safe as possible using
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) principles.[/i]


[b][u]Gameplay - Controls[/u][/b]
Click and drag objects from the navbar, or those already in the scene.
Pressing the Escape key will bring up the pause menu.


[b][u]Gameplay - Safe Objects[/u][/b]
Dragging an object to the scene will award points, depending on the object type and the position it was placed in.
Not all objects will award points, so think about how that object will impact the safety of that scene.

Hovering over an object in the navbar will bring up a short description on how it relates to CPTED principles.
Most objects will drop on the location of your cursor. Larger objects (such as fences) will snap to pre-defined positions. 

[u]Dragging an object will have a heatmap outline applied to it with various colours:[/u]

[b]Green:[/b] Good position - 10 points
[b]Yellow:[/b] Neutral position - 5 points
[b]Red:[/b] Bad position - 0 points

[i][b]Note:[/b] Heatmaps are only available in this tutorial level! You, as the player, will need to figure out the most optimal positions for the objects.[/i]


[b][u]Gameplay - Unsafe Objects[/u][/b]
There are also unsafe objects that are littered across the scene.
Clicking and dragging these objects will bring out a trashcan.
Placing an unsafe object in the trash also awards points.

As the environment becomes safer, the background sounds, or even the background itself may change. Use this to track your progress.
When you are finished, press the submit button in the top left to see your final score and feedback on how to improve your score.


[b][u]You will also be given a final rating based on the amount of points that you earned:[/u][/b]

[b]Gold:[/b] Full points
[b]Silver:[/b] 100 points
[b]Bronze:[/b] 30 points
[b]None:[/b] 0 points

[b][i]Good luck, and most importantly, have fun![/i]"
